# ML-Petroleum-Engineering
## This repository contains codes for Machine Learning research projects.

This repo holds the Python scripts for machine-learning research projects carried out in Petroleum Engineering for the year 2024. 
These were all contract jobs. These projects were done in the DataLab Notebook and I have transferred them here for reference purposes. 

Note that the codes might not show that certain libraries were installed because most libraries are already available on DataLab.
